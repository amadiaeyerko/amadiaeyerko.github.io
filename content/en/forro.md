## What is Forró?

In the doctoral dissertation of the Brazilian ethnomusicologist Adriana Fernandes there is a detailed historical account on the origins of forró, the meaning of the word itself and a description of the musical genres comprising forró. She defines forró as a “Brazilian dancing occasion accompanied by the live performance of a particular set of musical subgenres such as baião, xote, arrasta-pé and forró”, which all belong to the greater musical genre of forró. 
Thus, the word forró refers to three things

- A dancing occasion or party, where forró music is played
- A broad musical genre with different subgenres including baião, xote, arrasta-pé and forró
- A subgenre within the broad musical genre of forró

## The history and evolution of forró

Forró music has its roots in the northeastern Brazilian hinterlands of the 19th century, where it was a pastime at the end of a hard day of work in the countryside. Starting from the 1930s it started spreading to the more Southern parts of the country, such as to Rio de Janeiro or Sao Paulo, as people from the Northeast were emigrating to the economically more affluent south, in the hope of finding work.

Traditionally forró music was instrumental, the instruments being pifanos (cane fife), rabecas (folk violins) or oito baixos (button accordions with eight bass buttons). Later, in the 1940s the forró-musician Luiz Gonzaga revolutionized the genre and added lyrics to forró, replaced the button accordion with the piano accordion and added percussion realized by the triangle and the zabumba (bass drum). 

A further substantial change to the musical genre of forró can be attributed to the forró-musician Jackson do Pandeiro who was influenced by another Brazilian musical genre, namely samba. He added the pandeiro (hand frame drum with metal jingles) to forró and increased its tempo. The musical subgenre forró, within the broader genre of forró, was born. 

## Etymology
There are various explanations as to the origin of the word “forró”. The most widely accepted explanation states that the word “forró” is a short form for “forrbodó”, the latter meaning “entertainment” or “party”. 

## Musical characteristics common to all forró subgenres

How do we know that a song that we hear or listen to pertains to the genre of forró music? Well, there are some acoustic clues that can serve you as an indication. Firstly, most forró songs have a 2/4 meter. The most common chord sequences are V-I, IV-V-I and sometimes the dominant triad with an additional minor seventh. Typically, there is an alternation between sung and instrumental sections and the instruments include the trio of the zabumba (bass drum), the accordion and the triangle. 

In order to differentiate different genres within forró music, it is not sufficient to distinguish merely between single rhythmic patterns, as they are too similar to each other. This is why a distinction is made between a rhythmic complex, considering different rhythms for each instrument, beats per minute, etc. and other non-rhythmical characteristics.
