  Hello! My name is Amadia and over the years, dancing forr√≥ has become one of my favourite activities. I was born in Vienna and have lived in the Netherlands, Scotland, Belgium and Brazil. When I was young my mom introduced me to belly dancing and Middle Eastern folk dances. Ever since I have continued dancing, while discovering new rhythms and styles. Along the years, I have danced salsa, kizomba, bachata and funk.
