  Hello! My name is Amadia and I am from Vienna. My connection to dance started early in my life when, as a child, my mom introduced me to belly dancing and Middle Eastern folk dances. Ever since I have continued dancing, while discovering new rhythms and styles. I first got in touch with forró at party in the Brazilian Alto Paraíso de Goiás, where I was immediately mesmerized by the festive atmosphere, the colors, the music and the dance. Along the years, forró has become one of my favorite free-time activities.
